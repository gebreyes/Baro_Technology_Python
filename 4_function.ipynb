Joshua made a down payment of `25%` of the cost, and financed the remaining amount using a 6-year loan with an interest rate of `7%` per annum (compounded monthly). Joshua is now buying a car worth `$60,000`, which he is planning to finance using a 1-year loan with an interest rate of `12%` per annum. Both loans are paid back in EMIs. What is the total monthly payment Joshua makes towards loan repayment?\n",
